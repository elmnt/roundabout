# How To Use a Roundabout

This is my entry into the [10k Apart Contest](https://a-k-apart.com).

## Inspiration
Roundabouts have been growing in popularity in the U.S. for quite a while now. In my experience, when they replace a busy intersection that has regular and habitual traffic patterns, drivers tend to maintain those patterns in spite of the very simple and very obvious roundabout rules.

## About This Project

More details coming soon. Deadline is Friday (yikes!)
