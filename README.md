### Project Stats 

According to my final test, before submission: **7.799 KB**  

Tested on: [websiteoptimization.com](http://analyze.websiteoptimization.com/wso)  

There are a lot sources for page weight tests, with varying methods and result classifications. This was one of many that I used. I also relied heavily on Chrome's Dev Tools.  

### Conclusions  

There's a pretty large gap between the ideals of lightweight, semantic, accessible web pages, and the demands of most client work. Features get added. Code gets bloated. Pages get heavier.  

This project was a reminder of the fundamental structure that needs to sit under the modern app-driven web experience today. Working toward minimalism under technical constraints is always good practice.
