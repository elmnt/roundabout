# How To Use a Roundabout

This is my entry into the [10k Apart Contest](https://a-k-apart.com).  

Project site: [http://howtousearoundabout.com](http://howtousearoundabout.com)

#### Inspiration  

Roundabouts have been growing in popularity in the U.S. for quite a while now. In my experience, when they replace a busy intersection that has regular and habitual traffic patterns, drivers tend to maintain those patterns in spite of the very simple and very obvious roundabout rules.

#### Stats 

According to my final test, before submission: **7.817 KB**  

Tested on: [websiteoptimization.com](http://analyze.websiteoptimization.com/wso)  

There are a lot sources for page weight tests, with varying methods and result classifications. This was one of many that I used. I also relied heavily on Chrome's Dev Tools.  

#### Conclusions  

There's a pretty large gap between the ideals of lightweight, semantic, accessible web pages, and the demands of most client work. Features get added. Code gets bloated. Pages get heavier.  

Remember what your high school basketball coach used to say? "It's the fundamentals. Focus on the fundamentals." I didn't play basketball in high school. I don't even watch basketball. It's a lazy analogy. You get it.  

This project was a great reminder of the fundamental structure that needs to sit under the modern app-driven web experience today. And under the frameworks and libraries, maintaining semantic, accessible code takes effort.  

This was a fun exercise. Working toward minimalism under technical constraints is always great practice. 

#### Tools / Credit

The wealth of tools at the disposal of the designer/developer is amazing. I've added quite a few bookmarks, as a result of this project.
