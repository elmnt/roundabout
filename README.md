# How To Use a Roundabout

This is my entry for the 2016 [10k Apart Contest](https://a-k-apart.com).

### Inspiration  

This project was inspired by a roundabout that was installed in my small, coastal Southern California neighborhood, and the resulting traffic patterns. I found that people relied on previous right-of-way habits, while ignoring the obvious and simple way a roundabout works. So this was a chance to make fun of them. That's all.
